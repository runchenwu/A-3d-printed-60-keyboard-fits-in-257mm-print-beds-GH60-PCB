 A 3d printed 60% keyboard fits in 257mm print beds GH60 PCB compatible gasket mount tiny 16.1mm front height.

 It was inspired by the bridge 75
 The geometry for bottom case is jank with a thin 1mm section (I think)
 Im not very experienced with fusion unfortunately
 The plate only has 1 layout support which is ANSI 60%, but the dimensions of the plate are standard and easily replacable in fusion. In the video I used flush cutters to make the plate work.
 
 Instructions: 

 print the base diagonally on the edge to make it fit. Use supports
 Print the top flat on its top. print the accent pieces on their sides as its easier and gives contrast
 0.12mm layer height
 Plate can be laser cut or split in to parts to 3d print(not reccomended)
 use some screws with like around 2mm diameter and like 6mm long with the sharp threads so it doesnt get stuck.
 mounting method is gasket, add tape or anti slip mat on the top of the gasket, or attach to top case. add foam strip on the bottom. I used some 5mm foam strip that I cut to size.
